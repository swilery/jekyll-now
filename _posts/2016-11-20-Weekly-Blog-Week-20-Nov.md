title: 'Weekly Blog - Week 20 Nov'
---

This is my thirteenth weekly blog sharing my experience taking CS 373 â€“ Software Engineering with Dr. Fares Fraij. As usual, the following three questions will be addressed:

1. What did I do this past week?
2. What is in my way?
3. What will I do next week?

In addition, there will be the usual conclusion with my overall experience and a tip-of-the-week.

###### What did I do this past week?

We got Project 5 done and submitted. Firstly, we got our search function to work properly. Next we integrated another group's API into our site, displaying their data in a randomized fashion. Finally we filled up our wiki documentation and created our presentation slides to be presented in two weeks.   

###### What is in my way?

Nothing is in my way. The last project is finished, there is one more lecture, a presentation, and an exam. The end is in sight.   

###### What will I do next week?

There is nothing much left to be done for this class. Next week we have our final lecture so I will start preparing for the upcoming exam in two weeks. The pace is further slowed by the Thanksgiving Holiday.   

###### Overall Experience

All in all, Dr. Fraij did a pretty descent job in his first attempt at teaching CS373. The structure of the course is inherited from the template created by Dr. Downing, the hardest part of which is the projects. Each one is not intended to be the most technically challenging but is designed to force you to use the technologies currently utilized in the software development industry. Personally, I was fortunate enough to find a team that contained responsible members that were technically savvy, able to deliver when the pressure is on. The course is focused on preparing the student for a career in software development, placing emphasis on the techniques and tools currently employed. For those of you who are interested in such a career, this course is strongly recommended.

###### Tip-of-the-Week:
