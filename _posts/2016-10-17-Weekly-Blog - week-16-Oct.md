title: 'Weekly blog - week 16 Oct'

This is my eighth weekly blog sharing my experience taking CS 373 â€“ Software Engineering with Dr. Fares Fraij. As usual, the following three questions will be addressed:

1. What did I do this past week?
2. What is in my way?
3. What will I do next week?

In addition, there will be the usual conclusion with my overall experience and a tip-of-the-week.

###### What did I do this past week?

Project 3 was officially released last week so my group jumped on the task immediately and began brainstorming ideas on the website we are going to create. We jumped across different scenarios and finally ended up deciding to choose news as out topic of choice.

###### What is in my way?

The hardest task we have experienced so far is finding a good API for our webpage. Our initial ideas were scratched because we couldn't find decent sources for the three pillars of our website. In addition we experienced some delay due to the respective learning curves to the foray of tools that we are required to use. 

###### What will I do next week?

Next week, we will finish Phase 1 of the project. More specifically, we will need to craft a documentation of our webpage and actually build the static pages that serves the content we are planning on presenting.  

###### Overall Experience

For the rest of the class, we are building a website for our projects. Each project consists of a phase that adds more functionality to the overall end product. It really is exciting to be building something like this since this is something that can actually be used immediately. All the tools we are using are actually used in industry, so the work we are doing is an accurate reflection of what a career in web development may be like. However, it is worthwhile to mention that in industry, your sole responsibility is the webpage or part of the webpage you are crafting. This is not the case for this course because your time and attention are also pulled by your other courses so it is imperative to start as early as possible and find a group of mates that are able to pull their weight when the going gets tough.

###### Tip-of-the-Week:
