title: 'Blog: Week of 28 Aug 2016'
---

For the next few months, I will attempt to post a weekly blog sharing my experience taking CS 373 â€“ Software Engineering with Dr. Fares Fraij. This post will primarily answer three questions:
What did I do this past week?
What is in my way?
What will I do next week?

Finally I will conclude with a tip-of-the-week.

What did I do this past week?

The answer simple: Collatz. Collatz is the first programming assignment for this course, designed to familiarize us with some of the tools currently used in the programming industry. I was able to get most of the requirements done this past week, but due to the fact that out TA hasn't been set, there are still some details left hanging in the air. 

What is in my way?

Nothing really. Currently the semester has just began so things are just slowly picking up. However, come next week it is almost certain the situation will be quite different. As in previous semesters, time will be the crutch. There will be not enough hours in the day to accomplish all that needs to be accomplished.

What will I do next week?

The main thing is to finish Collatz. Next is to start sniffing out potential partners for the next programming assignment. This is in addition to getting back into the routine of school life. Also, we mustn't forget that hopefully there will be another blog post next week.

Overall Experience

There has been only one lecture so not much can be said at the moment. However, the first programming assignment Collatz can be quite tedious. The assignment as a whole is not too difficult but getting used to the environment and tools can be time-consuming. In particular I will mention Sphere, a website that tests your solutions to programming problems. The error messages produced by that website is bare-bones minimum making it a difficult site to use. You have been warned.

Tip-of-the-Week: One of the friends you'll make is the Python 3.5.2 Documentation. Nuff said: https://docs.python.org/3/
