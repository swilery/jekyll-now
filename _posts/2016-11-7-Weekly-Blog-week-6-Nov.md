title: 'Weekly Blog, week 6 Nov'
---

This is my eleventh weekly blog sharing my experience taking CS 373 â€“ Software Engineering with Dr. Fares Fraij. As usual, the following three questions will be addressed:

1. What did I do this past week?
2. What is in my way?
3. What will I do next week?

In addition, there will be the usual conclusion with my overall experience and a tip-of-the-week.

###### What did I do this past week?

We rushed to get Project 4 done and submitted. We established the database schema and linked it with our application. Also we were able to get our model to correctly import Flask. Basically this week we did the meat of Phase II.

###### What is in my way?

Currently there is nothing roadblocking Software Engineering besides the usual competition for time and the ever-present juggling of resources with the other courses. 

###### What will I do next week?

Project 5, the final project, will be officially released. As usual, hopefully, my team can jump on the task immediately with relatively few hiccups. Perhaps we may get a significant portion of it done next week.  

###### Overall Experience

When doing the projects for this course, there may be instances in which you may find some of the requirements a bit arbitrary. However, if you do the readings, you'll realize that the project requirements have practices of Extreme Programming built into them. Take the last three projects for example. They are, in reality, one project separated into three phases. Each phase is given about nine days to do. These phases correspond to the iterations practiced in Extreme Programming, where you estimate the amount of work you can accomplish during a week and actually go about doing that work. In fact, as part of our project submissions, we have always been asked to report an estimated time and an actual time. In addition, during Phase I where asked to write unit tests for functionality that are to be implemented in Phase II, another aspect of Extreme Programming. 

###### Tip-of-the-Week:
> There is a way of parsing using derivatives. 

Use this wisely: <http://conf.researchr.org/event/pldi-2016/pldi-2016-papers-on-the-complexity-and-performance-of-parsing-with-derivatives>
