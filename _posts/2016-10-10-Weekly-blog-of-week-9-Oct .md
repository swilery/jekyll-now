title: 'Weekly blog of week 9 Oct'

This is my seventh weekly blog sharing my experience taking CS 373 â€“ Software Engineering with Dr. Fares Fraij. As usual, the following three questions will be addressed:

1. What did I do this past week?
2. What is in my way?
3. What will I do next week?

In addition, there will be the usual conclusion with my overall experience and a tip-of-the-week.

###### What did I do this past week?

Early on in the week, I created a cheat sheet for the exam. The exam was on Thursday, after which I placed Software Engineering on standby.   

###### What is in my way?

Nothing is really in the way for Software Engineering. My other courses, however, are beating me into the sand. Both have upcoming exams and non-trivial assignments that are eating away at huge chunks of my never-enough time. 

###### What will I do next week?

Next week, project 3 will be officially released. I have just successfully established a team. Hopefully we can hash out our meeting times so that we can begin as soon as possible and start making headway into the project. 

###### Overall Experience

The big event last week was the Exam. I would say that the exam was fairly written. The announcements Dr. Fraij made in class about the exam were accurate descriptions of what the exam would be like. The only thing that I am a bit disappointed in is that I wasn't able to prepare for it as much as I wanted. This phenomenon will very likely occur with my future exams in this and in my other courses. Personally in the past, I usually would have been able to dedicate a large amount of time to make a multi-pass over the exam material. However, I think last year would be the last one in which I will be able to do that. This is not an indication of anything related to CS373 in particular but an overall comment about taking multiple time-intensive courses. Sometimes sacrifices will have to be made on critical tasks.  

###### Tip-of-the-Week:

You will probably hate me for this: <http://llvm.org/>
