title: 'Weekly blog of week 2 Oct'

This is my sixth weekly blog sharing my experience taking CS 373 â€“ Software Engineering with Dr. Fares Fraij. As usual, the following three questions will be addressed:

1. What did I do this past week?
2. What is in my way?
3. What will I do next week?

In addition, there will be the usual conclusion with my overall experience and a tip-of-the-week.

###### What did I do this past week?

Surprisingly over the weekend, I was able to study for the upcoming exam. Also as a side note, I was able to form a group in anticipation for project 3. We have exchanged our contact information but we have yet to synchronize our schedules.  

###### What is in my way?

The big crunch has to do with the unrelenting wave of assignments emanating from my other courses. Since Dr. Fraij gave us a break this week for the upcoming exam, Software Engineering has been relatively roadblock-free.

###### What will I do next week?

Ideally, I will continue to prepare for that exam and get that cheat sheet down. However, the reality is most likely that I will divert my attention away from Software Engineering and towards other assignments that needs tackling.  

###### Overall Experience

The word on the street is that Dr. Downing has his students take their exams on Canvas and has their subsequent code graded in the terminal. Thankfully Dr. Fraij has mentioned that our exams will be on paper. He is mainly worried that some glitch may occur that will detrimentally impact performance on the exam. I concur with his worries. In addition, there is the fact that a compiler exists for a reason. Maybe that is a bit too general. Perhaps, it is more precise to say that a lexer exists for a reason. I personally would not want a Software Engineering course to test lexicographical accuracy instead of software engineering. That would be a poorly engineered exam, pun intended.       

###### Tip-of-the-Week:
