This is my ninth weekly blog sharing my experience taking CS 373 â€“ Software Engineering with Dr. Fares Fraij. As usual, the following three questions will be addressed:

1. What did I do this past week?
2. What is in my way?
3. What will I do next week?

In addition, there will be the usual conclusion with my overall experience and a tip-of-the-week.

###### What did I do this past week?

Last week, my group has been scrambling to get Project 3 turned in on time. We got the server up early on in the week but time became scarce when we were working on writing the HTML files that contained our pillars and writing our wiki documentations. In the end, we managed to satisfy all the requirements for this phase of the project. 

###### What is in my way?

As usual nowadays, the big roadblock is multitasking. We are in the middle of the semester, meaning classes with major projects are getting ready to assign those project and exams are given out liberally. The major challenge is to get everything done on time, usually it means sacrificing quality to do so.

###### What will I do next week?

Next week, Project 4 will be officially announced. Hopefully, my group will be jumping on that task immediately and making some significant headway into it.

###### Overall Experience

Time is of the essence. When a project is released, it is imperative that progress be made on it immediately. The members of my group unanimously agreed that a week's worth of time completing these phases is barely enough. The time crunch is compounded by the fact that each of the members of my team are taking other time-intensive courses. So each day counts. A nice thing about these groups is that we are required five members. Tsignificantly increases the change that at least half of the members are able to meet for a good portion of time to work on the projects. However, this is a doubly-edged since the more members you have, the harder it is to coordinate among the members. So the key is constant explicit open communication between the members. Also, it is very desirable that each member can pull his or her own weight so the team can progress steadily to the finish line even in the face of unexpected obstacles.
