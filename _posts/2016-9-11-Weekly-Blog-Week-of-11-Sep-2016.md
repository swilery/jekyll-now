title: 'Weekly Blog: Week of 11 Sep 2016'
---

This is my third weekly blog sharing my experience taking CS 373 â€“ Software Engineering with Dr. Fares Fraij. As usual, the following three questions will be addressed:

1. What did I do this past week?
2. What is in my way?
3. What will I do next week?

In addition, there will be the usual conclusion with my overall experience and a tip-of-the-week.

###### What did I do this past week?

The main task for CS 373 was getting the project ready for submission. There were some last minute rat-killing we had to do, which is to be expected from an assignment that uses so many tools. 

###### What is in my way?

So far things are alright, no major obstacles for CS 373. (The same thing cannot be said for my other classes.) I incorrectly assumed that Project 2 will be released last Thursday so it was nice to have (another) break.

###### What will I do next week?

Next Tuesday, the second project commences. Both my partner and I agreed to get as much done, if not finish the thing next week so that we free up time in both of our schedules to tackle any future tasks that are sure to come. 

###### Overall Experience

The following statement may or may not be correct, but Professor Glenn Downing is the architect of CS 373. There is an approach to his teaching that is truly interesting and deserves a mention: The coding examples presented in lectures are runnable. That is, students do not have to take at face value that the code presented is correct or even type up the examples themselves and run them to verify their correctness. All coding examples are presented on Github, and are readily runnable. Any language feature presented in lecture are easily verifiable by the students just by pulling, compiling, and running. Of course Downing is not the only professor that provides real compilable code but he is unique in the consistency and in the organized-fashion in which he does it.

To the confused reader: Fraij is my professor but Downing is the architect (maybe).

###### Tip-of-the-Week:
