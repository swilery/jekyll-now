title: 'Weekly Blog: Week of 25 Sep 2016'
---

This is my fifth weekly blog sharing my experience taking CS 373 â€“ Software Engineering with Dr. Fares Fraij. As usual, the following three questions will be addressed:

1. What did I do this past week?
2. What is in my way?
3. What will I do next week?

In addition, there will be the usual conclusion with my overall experience and a tip-of-the-week.

###### What did I do this past week?

My partner and I have been working on Netflix the first part of the week. We were able to get it done on Wednesday pretty smoothly. Unfortunately, we received a message Friday morning stating that the Git SHA we submitted did not match the last one recorded by Travis. My partner investigated and found out that Travis built our commits in a slightly different order than ones on Github. Alas, a resubmission was requested. 

###### What is in my way?

Since Netflix has finished and the exam is the week following the next week, I get to have a small break from Software Engineering. So nothing is in my way for this class. However, I would say that errors due to tools and equipment outside of my control does provide speed bumps for this course. 

###### What will I do next week?

Ideally, I will begin preparing for the upcoming exam. However, the reality is most likely that I will divert my attention away from Software Engineering and towards other assignments that needs tackling.  

###### Overall Experience

Many people previously have mentioned that this course emphasizes on obtaining first-hand experience on some of the tools used in industry at the moment. This provides valuable skills, the benefits of which should not be taken lightly. However, the flip side to this characteristic is that since our grades are tied to the functionality of these tools, an error in their execution or an unexpected side-effect may inadvertently hurt our grades. Please be aware of this fact and expect the unexpected.     

###### Tip-of-the-Week: 
> This is a pretty sweet IDE for writing X86 code.
