title: 'Weekly Blog, week 30 Oct'

This is my tenth weekly blog sharing my
experience taking CS 373 â€“ Software Engineering with Dr. Fares
Fraij. As usual, the following three questions will be addressed:

1. What did I do this past week?
2. What is in my way?
3. What will I do next week?

In addition, there will be the usual conclusion with my overall experience and a tip-of-the-week.

###### What did I do this past week?

Project 4 was officially released on Tuesday so my team has started working on it. So far we haven't accomplished anything much besides setting up the database. Although we have code that sets up the schema, we haven't got around to verifying whether it actually runs.

###### What is in my way?

A significant portion of the team is busy with other classes which hinders our development of this phase. This causes a more or less lack of progress in the previous week. Hopefully, more members are free to work next week. 

###### What will I do next week?

The goal of next week is to get Project 4 done and submitted. This requires us to construct the database schema and modify our application to actually retrieve our data from the database. In addition, we need to get our loader and model to import Flask correctly, which was an issue carried over from the previous project. 

###### Overall Experience

There as been a few instances in which guest speakers from industry have been invited to give a presentation during class. Since this course is designed to give its students experience with real world tools and techniques so that they may have an easier time acquiring a job in industry, bringing in possible recruiters fits well in the implementation of the course. These instances provide exposure to some of the possible career options currently available and gives the students a stepping stone to possible future direction in their professional lives. In regards to those who are naturally untalented when it comes to job hunting, these experiences can present helpful insights that can make one better at the game.
