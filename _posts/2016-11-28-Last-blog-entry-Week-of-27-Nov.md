title: 'Last blog entry - Week of 27 Nov'
---

This is my last weekly blog sharing my experience taking CS 373 â€“ Software Engineering with Dr. Fares Fraij. As usual, the following three questions will be addressed:

1. What did I do this past week?
2. What is in my way?
3. What will I do next week?

In addition, there will be the usual conclusion with my overall experience and a tip-of-the-week.

###### What did I do this past week?

Last week was the Thanksgiving Holiday so I didn't do much of Software Engineering. All I managed to do is study for the upcoming exam that is to take place on Thursday.    

###### What is in my way?

Nothing is in my way. The last project is finished. All that remains is a presentation and an exam. The end is near.   

###### What will I do next week?

There is nothing much left to be done for this class. Next week we will give a quick presentation of our website and the class will end with an exam. So I will be doing some final preparations for that test like coming up with a cheat sheet.  

###### Overall Experience

I was looking through the class materials. The more you look at them the more you see that the contents of Dr. Downing's GitHub files mainly focuses on the details of the language he is using to teach his course. That is, the files mainly consist of Python or SQL language features and less about Software Engineering in general. One possible explanation for this is that Software Engineering is a broad topic. It basically lumps together the leftover topics not already assigned to some specified domain, sort of like how discrete mathematics came about as a lump some of topics. So this course will inevitably feel like a course about programming with some esoteric features related to good software practices. The ideas introduced in this course are thus learn-able by experience. This highlights the fact that the real value of this course is comes from the tools it forces you to use.

###### Tip-of-the-Week:
>  Concurrent write is a blessing for pair projects.
