title: 'Weekly Blog: Week of 18 Sep 2016'
---

This is my fourth weekly blog sharing my experience taking CS 373 â€“ Software Engineering with Dr. Fares Fraij. As usual, the following three questions will be addressed:

1. What did I do this past week?
2. What is in my way?
3. What will I do next week?

In addition, there will be the usual conclusion with my overall experience and a tip-of-the-week.

###### What did I do this past week?

Last Tuesday, the second project was released. My partner and I have been tackling with it this past week. We started the project pretty early so there weren't a lot of caches to work with so we went about trying to create our own caches.

###### What is in my way?

The process cache creation was cumbersome for us. This is because the caches we ended up creating were gigabytes in size so they take a long time to write. The task was made harder by the fact that during the time we were working on it, we weren't able to write its contents to a publicly writable directory. So after two days of work, not a single working cache.

###### What will I do next week?

Since now there are more caches written by other groups, hopefully we can start progressing into the meat of the project. The project is due Thursday so we will be working to get it completed. 

###### Overall Experience

We are at the point where project groups are starting to form so students should expect to receive  a good dose of pair programming. It really helps to have a partner or group member who can complement the tasks that you do. It has the potential of speeding up code development quite a bit. On the other hand, working with someone incompatible can put a serious dent on efficiency. Choose your mates wisely.    

###### Tip-of-the-Week: 
> There is a cute tool for playing around with a database schema. This may or may not be useful later.
