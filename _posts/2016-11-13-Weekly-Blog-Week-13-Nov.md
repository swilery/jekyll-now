title: 'Weekly Blog - Week 13 Nov'
---

This is my twelfth weekly blog sharing my experience taking CS 373 â€“ Software Engineering with Dr. Fares Fraij. As usual, the following three questions will be addressed:

1. What did I do this past week?
2. What is in my way?
3. What will I do next week?

In addition, there will be the usual conclusion with my overall experience and a tip-of-the-week.

###### What did I do this past week?

Project 5 was officially released on Tuesday. Even though we began work on it pretty early, not much progress has been made. What we did manage to do it set up a auto-updates for our database. 

###### What is in my way?

We have been experiencing problems with the search function from SQLAlchemy-Searchable. Whenever we pass it a string we want to search, it returns empty even though the string we passed in exists in our database. The main bugger is that we can't seem to find the documentation for that function so we have no idea what it does besides speculating that it does a search.  

###### What will I do next week?

We will be working on Project 5 to get it done and submitted. Hopefully we can quickly move past the search fiasco and start making actual progress on the website.   

###### Overall Experience

When I initially heard about CS373 and it's many group projects, I couldn't help associating it with CS439. However it came as a pleasant surprise that the projects we encounter in this course are much easier than the projects for Operating Systems. In other words, if your experience in CS439 was not the greatest, that should not be a main deterrent to not taking this course. Fumbling with system code is significantly different than fumbling with a website.  There are instances in which you encounter some obstacle but these instances usually last a lot shorter. 

###### Tip-of-the-Week:
> Usually problems can be formulates into two step: Determining whether a solution exists and then finding a solution if it exists. 

For example, given an Earley Recognizer, construct a parser from it: <http://loup-vaillant.fr/tutorials/earley-parsing/parser>
